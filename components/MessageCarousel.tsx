The methods we used to teach and the ways by which our students learn are unique and creative. Consistently, we never hesitated to investigate our deficiencies and transform us to an agent of social change. The institute has substantially contributed to the process of National building by providing quality education and thereby enabling the students to become globally competent. We have plans and dreams in the years to come. We propose to introduce Academic Audit for every department by external experts. This aims at regular scrutiny of the quality teaching and the content of teaching.\n\nEducation is not an act of acquiring knowledge but learning a skill to lead life and forming one’s personality. This is an ennobling process of growth. I can boldly say that we have excelled in every initiative that we undertook, and we have stood together in facing the challenges in realizing quality education. In all this, we have made every effort to be sensitive and compassionate to the marginalized and the people in need.\n\nGrowing Ahead of Time ....\n\nMy best wishes to all prospective students and regards to the parents for having bestowed their faith in us.\n\nRemaining at your service 24X7,",
